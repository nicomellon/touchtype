## Gameplay

The objective of TouchType is to improve your typing skills by practicing typing on the keyboard. The game consists of a series of levels, and each level introduces new keys on the keyboard.

Upon starting the game you will be presented with a sequence of characters that you need to type as accurately and quickly as possible.

Once you feel comfortable with the keys in play, press `Enter` to move to the next level. With each level new keys are introduced.
