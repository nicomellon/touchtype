# TouchType

**TouchType** is a command-line application designed to help you practice typing on your keyboard. With a series of levels, each introducing new keys on the keyboard, TouchType is a fun and interactive way to improve your typing skills. 

## Installation

TouchType can be easily installed using `pip`, the Python package installer. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```shell
pip install touchtype
```

Please note that **Python 3.6 or above** is required to run TouchType.

## Getting Started

Once TouchType is successfully installed, you can start the program by typing `touchtype` at the command line.

```shell
touchtype
```

This command will start the touchtype home screen. From here you can set your preferences, and launch any of the touchtype game modes.

## Game modes -Â Tutorial

The tutorial introduces new keys on the keyboard little by little, starting with the keys under the index fingers on the home row.

Once you feel comfortable with the keys in play, press `Enter` to move to the next level. With each level new keys are introduced.

At any point, you can exit the game by pressing `Ctrl+C` or `Ctrl+D` on your keyboard.
